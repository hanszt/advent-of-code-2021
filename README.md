# Advent of code 2021

## Introduction
This is a project to participate in [AdventOfCode 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This year I'm participating using Kotlin:
