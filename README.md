# Advent of code 2021

## Introduction
This is a project to participate in [AdventOfCode 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This year I'm participating using Kotlin:

## Results
Most of the days I was able to solve myself. When a problem is inherently recursive, I tend to struggle with it al lot.

That's why I was not able to solve all parts myself. For those parts I looked at how others came to a solution

These are the repo's I visited too see the solutions for the parts I was not able to solve myself.
- [Day 16 packet decoder part 1 and 2](https://github.com/TheTurkeyDev/Advent-of-Code-2021/blob/main/src/dev/theturkey/aoc2021/Day16.java)
- [Day 18 snail fish part 1 and 2](https://github.com/elizarov/AdventOfCode2021/blob/main/src/Day18.kt)
- [Day 19 beacon scanner part 1 and 2](https://github.com/elizarov/AdventOfCode2021/blob/main/src/Day19_fast.kt)
- [Day 21 dirac dice part 2](https://github.com/elizarov/AdventOfCode2021/blob/main/src/Day21_2.kt)

This was very educational to see. Many thanks to Roman Elizarov and the TurkeyDev for providing there solutions on GitHub!

Full credits for Roman Elizarov and the turkey dev for these days!
